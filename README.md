# About me

Hi, I’m Eckhard but call me Ecko. I’m interested in doing something valueable, work with smart people, enjoy time with my family. 

During the last 14 years I worked as full stack developer with .NET and Web technologies. In last 5 years my focus was on organizing product development teams as CEO of a software development conrtactor.
